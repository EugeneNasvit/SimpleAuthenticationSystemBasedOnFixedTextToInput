The program works in two modes: - training (creation of a biometric sample) - identification (comparison with a biometric standard). 
At the stage of learning statistical parameters are determined by reference keyboard writing - estimate of 
mathematical expectation and variance of the duration of time intervals between keystrokes and total time typing. 
Settings are written to the files (files are put in the folder, which is named as registered username). 
Education is repeated on a fixed set of reference phrase. At the stage of identification entered control phrase parameters 
are being defined. Begins the verification of the hypothesis that estimates the expectation and variance 
are the same distribution as the reference biometric parameters. Results are displayed in message dialog. 
On the stages of training and identification supposed rejection blunders (individual measurements).
